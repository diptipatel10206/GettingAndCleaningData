This repo contains files generated from the course project in the Getting And Cleaning Data online class.

##run_analysis.R
This script cleans the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones dataset that can be downloaded from
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.  These two datasets 
(train and test) were read into R and merged.  Labels of the activities were added and the measurements of 
mean() and std() are extracted to produce the first tidy dataset.  From this dataset the final tidy dataset
is created by grouping each measurement by subject and activity then calculating the average of each 
measurement.

##Codebook.md##
This is the codebook for the final tidy dataset, *HumanActRecog.csv*.  It describes the variables from the Human
Activity Recognition experiment.

##HumanActRecog.csv##
This file is the final tidy dataset generated by *run_analysis.R*.  

##HumanActRecog.txt##
This file is a copy of the tidy dataset in *txt format.
